## Installation

### certificates

To generate all certificates, we can use:
```
kubeadm init phase certs all
```

If we owns a root CA, we can use it to generate K8S CA and generate each other certificates by hand instead of directly generating "all"

### Control plane

Check node requirements

```
kubeadm init phase preflight
```

With kubeadm control-plane components are spawned as static pods on the node's kubelet.
First step is to start the kubelet with the right config

```
kubeadm init phase kubelet-start
```

To connect to the cluster, clients (cluster components, users, ...) must use a kubeconfig file which holds their
credentials and information on the cluster (cluster API server endpoint, CA certificate to validate the https exposed
certificate, ...). kubeadm will generate these files for us using the already generated certificates.

```
kubeadm init phase kubeconfig all
```

We will now use kubeadm to create the static pods manifests for control-plane components:

```
kubeadm init phase control-plane all
```

Deploy etcd

```
kubeadm init phase etcd local
```

Copy `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` on the machine where your kubectl stands
- either in ~/.kube/config
- or anywhere you want, but set the variable KUBECONFIG

Then we have to mark this node as control plane

```
kubeadm init phase mark-control-plane
```

Deploy kube proxy which handle service to pods traffic distribution

```
kubeadm init phase addon kube-proxy
```

Upload kubelet and kubeadm as configmap in the cluster (required for new node to be able to join the cluster)

```
kubeadm init phase upload-config all
```

### Worker nodes

On control plane, generate a join command that contains control-plane IP and bootstrap token required to join the cluster.

```
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

This will output something like

> kubeadm join 192.168.1.28:6443 --token fi7yjm.v4q7itngzsd3ljeu --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0993272d75d069e454714aba33439e7adf0f7a550c2ea401886a9cb98132da9f 

Then on worker node, use join command to initialize worker node and join cluster. E.G

```
kubeadm join <control-plane-ip> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <discovery-token>
```
