## Quotas

When sharing a cluster between projects/teams,you should define some resource Quotas.These Quotas apply on

- Compute resources
- Extended resources
- Storage resources
- Resource count

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: pods-high
  namespace: quotas
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "4"
    memory: 2Gi
    pods: "4"
```

Prevent namespace "quotas" to use more than 4 pods, 2G memory or 4 CPUs.

### Debug

If you try to create a deployment with more than 4 replicas, only 4 will be created. You can check why by inspecting the replicaset

kubectl describe rs -l <deployment labels>
