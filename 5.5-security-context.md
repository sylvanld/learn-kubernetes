## Security context

Using this we can define the security context user/groups used inside our pods. May apply **at pod or container level**.

### Common properties

- **runAsUser**: the first process of the Pod containers will run as uid
- **runAsGroup**: default gid of files created in volumes
- **runAsNonRoot**: if set to true, the Kubelet won't allow root to run the container
- **seLinuxOptions**: SELinux context to be applied to all containers
- **supplementalsGroups**: other gid associated to the user running containers

### Pod properties

- **fsGroup**: default gid of the process and change the group owner of the files for somevolume types

### Container properties

- **allowPrivilegeEscalationcapabilities**: 
- **capabilities** to add/drop
- **privileged**: if set to true, the container will run as privileged
- **readOnlyRootFilesystem**

### Example

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: shell-security
  labels:
    name: shell-security
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 37
    fsGroup: 100
    supplementalGroups: [11, 18, 19, 100]
  containers:
  - name: shell-security
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp
      name: tmp
  volumes:
  - name: tmp
    emptyDir: {}
```

- This pod will run as user 37 (see /etc/passwd)
- Created files will be owned by group 100 (see /etc/group)
- User who run the pod will have groups [11, 18, 19, 100]
